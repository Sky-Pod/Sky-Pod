<h1>How to Read Sky Music Sheets</h1>

<p>The visual music sheets on this website are a bit like <a href="./discord.html">tablature</a>, which is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.</p>

<p>So in the below example, you simply press where the Sky music sheet asks you to, which on the ABC1-5 reference chart is A3, B2 and C4</p>

<h3>What do the colours mean</h3>
<p>They're just a way to differentiate between rows (A, B and C) to make the sheets a bit easier to read.</p>
<p><b>However!</b></p>
If you find a section like the image below it generally means the notes are played in a fast pace one after the other, from light to dark colour.

Lastly, if you come across a blank space with a dot in the middle.

<p>This signifies a pause in the song.</p>

<p>Please note that all the sheets on this website are fan-made and are the creator's own interpretation. If you already know the song and its rhythm in your head, it will help reading the music sheets here.</p>
